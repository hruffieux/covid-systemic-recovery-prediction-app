## Integrative prediction of systemic recovery from COVID-19

This repository contains the source code for the RShiny app providing pilot predictions of incomplete organismal recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The tool can be accessed here: [http://shiny.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/apps/covid-19-systemic-recovery-prediction-app/](http://shiny.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/apps/covid-19-systemic-recovery-prediction-app/).

The study and methodology behind the development of this tool are described in the following publication:
